title: "Theoretical Analysis of CNNs for Automatic Seizure Detection in EEG Signals" excerpt: "Undergraduate Honors Thesis using PyTorch, SMOTE, and Lipschitz bounds to achieve 97% accuracy in seizure detection. 

This project represents my Undergraduate Honors Thesis at UCF. I bridged the gap between deep learning application and mathematical theory to detect seizure activity in EEG signals.

Technical Highlights

Architecture: Developed a 1D CNN using PyTorch for signal classification.

Performance: Achieved 97% Accuracy and 0.99 AUC on the University of Bonn dataset.

Rigorous Analysis: Used Lipschitz bounds to verify model stability and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to interpret learned features.

Signal Processing: Implemented a Butterworth noise filtering pipeline and used SMOTE for data imbalance.
