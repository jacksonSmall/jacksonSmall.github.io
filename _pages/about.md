## Hello! I'm Jackson Small

I am a highly motivated Data Science student at the **University of Central Florida's Burnett Honors College**, pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree (expected May 2026, 3.806 GPA). My passion lies in applying statistical rigor and advanced machine learning to solve complex challenges, particularly those involving large-scale data and automation.

I am driven by a curiosity to connect the **theoretical foundations of machine learning** with robust, high-impact engineering solutions.

### Professional Experience & Impact

My experience focuses on delivering tangible results, optimizing enterprise systems, and working at the frontier of AI application:

* **AI Associate Developer at Insurity, Inc. (Remote | Oct 2025 – Present):**
    * Developed and deployed machine learning models and RAG/LLM prototypes, utilizing prompt engineering to create new insurance solutions and presenting Proof-of-Concepts (POCs) to senior engineers.
    * Engineered custom Python and PowerShell automation scripts to migrate 175 enterprise SSRS reports to Power BI, resulting in an **83% reduction in processing time and achieving $6,480 in cost savings.**
    * Designed a reusable **6-phase migration framework** that delivered a **38x ROI**.

* **Research Assistant Intern at Design Interactive, Inc. (Orlando, FL | May 2024 – Aug 2024):**
    * Gained hands-on experience in human systems integration research, assisting in experiment design, managing research integrity, and preparing statistical reports for the R&D team.

### Core Technical Expertise

My technical foundation is built on a strong core of programming, statistical theory, and deep learning frameworks:

| Category | Skills & Tools | 
| :--- | :--- | 
| **Languages** | Python, SQL, JavaScript, R, Julia, C, Bash | 
| **ML/Deep Learning** | PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, LLMs, RAG | 
| **Data Engineering** | Data Pipelines, Git, Azure DevOps, AWS, SPARK | 
| **Analytics/BI** | Power BI, Tableau, Streamlit, A/B Testing | 
| **Concepts** | Statistical Modeling, Prompt Engineering, Predictive Analytics | 

### Academic Research & Projects

My commitment to deep learning is evidenced by my Honors Thesis and end-to-end applications:

* **Honors Thesis: Theoretical Analysis of CNNs for Automatic Seizure Detection in EEG Signals:** This research bridges theory and application. I used **PyTorch** to develop a 1D CNN model (97% accuracy/0.99 AUC) and applied **Lipschitz bounds** and **DFT** to verify stability and interpret learned features.
* **AI Driver Risk Scoring Platform:** A full-stack project where I engineered features, trained ML models (ROC-AUC 0.98), and built a **real-time risk dashboard** using **Streamlit** for telematics data.

### Leadership & Community

Outside of my technical work, I am committed to community service and analytical collaboration:

* **Eagle Scout (BSA):** Led a project involving the construction of two community library boxes, fostering literacy and collaboration with the local Fire Department.
* **Collegiate Mathematical Society:** Active member; contributed to analytical discussions and engaged the public by presenting mathematical concepts (like the Monty Hall Problem and Hilbert’s Hotel Paradox) at UCF’s STEM Day.
* **CRU:** Youth Group Leader and musician (percussion/drums) for the worship team.

### Let's Connect!

I am actively seeking opportunities to leverage my skills in data science, machine learning, and automation. Feel free to connect with me via [Email](mailto:jacksonSmall@ucf.edu) or explore my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/jacksonSmall).



<!-- **Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful. -->
