Hi! I am Jackson Small, a 4th-year Data Science student at the University of Central Florida.

Skills and Interests
======
As a student, I am actively gaining proficiency in a range of data science tools including: 

- **Languages & Platforms**: Python, SQL, Tableau, R, SPARK, Julia, C, Git, VSC.
- **Library Skills**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, scikit-learn.
- **Programming Skills**: Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Data Structures, Data Engineering.

I have a keen interest in the Deep Learning sector of Data Science in fields like Automatic Seizure Detection in EEG Signals, which is the focus of my Honors Undergraduate Thesis. I believe a strong foundation in statistics and mathematics is essential to fully understand and effectively create accurate and interpretable machine learning models.


Beyond Academics
======

- BSA Eagle Scout
    - My Eagle Scout project involved constructing two little library boxes for two parks, working collaboratively with the local fire department to create more community involvement and a hub for literary growth. 
- CRU
    - Youth Group Leader since 2024, aiding in leading the Lake Claire Community Group at UCF. I play percussion (cajon/drums) for the worship team!
- Collegiate Mathematical Society at UCF
    - Attended the American Mathematical Society (AMS) conference, which gathers mathematicians, researchers, and students to share cutting-edge research and explore new mathematical trends.
    - STEM Day at UCF: Presented and engaged with K-12 students with the help of the Collegiate Mathematical Society about mathematical phenomena such as Hilbert’s Hotel Paradox, Monty Hall, and Möbius Strip.



<!-- **Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful. -->
